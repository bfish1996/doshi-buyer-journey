# Doshi Across Retail Banking Buyer Journeys

This document maps the **buyer journeys** for three institution types — **Big Banks, Building Societies, Credit Unions** — and overlays **Doshi’s role** for **new customers (Doshi as leader)** and **existing customers (Doshi as contributor)**.

---

## 1. Awareness

| Institution | Buyer Journey | Doshi (New Customers) | Doshi (Existing Customers) |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Big Banks** | Awareness via mass marketing (TV, sponsorships, digital ads). High brand recall. | **Leader:** Content-led campaigns (TikTok, Insta, YouTube) → Doshi app download for financial coaching → soft intro to bank. | **Minimal role:** Existing customers already aware. Awareness nudges may resurface (“your bank offers free coaching”) but impact is low. |
| **Building Societies** | Awareness local, reputation-based, heritage branding. | **Leader:** Campaigns highlight “community + learning” → Doshi is a trust-builder (“Bath Building Society helps you get money smart”). | **Minimal:** Already members, but Doshi can re-raise awareness of *new services/products*. |
| **Credit Unions** | Awareness via community groups, word of mouth. Very low budget. | **Leader:** Community campaigns: “Free money coaching for members” → Doshi entry. | **Contributor:** Raise awareness of products members don’t realise CU offers (loans, savings). |

## 2. Consideration

| Institution | Buyer Journey | Doshi (New Customers) | Doshi (Existing Customers) |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Big Banks** | Customers compare on rates, UX, trust. Digital-heavy. | **Leader:** Doshi acts as a low-friction *trial of the brand*. User interacts with content before product decision → builds trust. | **Contributor:** Surface “why stay?” value → nudges tied to product features (ISA explainer, credit builder lessons). |
| **Building Societies** | Considered for mortgages/savings, ethics, mutuality. | **Leader:** Doshi strengthens “mutual” identity — *“we help you learn, not just sell.”* | **Contributor:** Content shows *why* existing members should consider additional products. |
| **Credit Unions** | Consideration often about access & fairness. | **Leader:** Doshi gives legitimacy, showing CU is modern and member-first. | **Contributor:** Doshi combats “CU = only for loans” misconception → education opens cross-sell. |

## 3. Decision (Onboarding / Sign-up)

| Institution | Buyer Journey | Doshi (New Customers) | Doshi (Existing Customers) |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Big Banks** | Digital-first onboarding, slick flows. | **Leader:** Doshi bridges from “learn about credit” → CTA to open account. Onboards user into bank via coaching. | **Contributor:** Embedded in first-week comms. Guides salary deposit, savings goal, card usage. |
| **Building Societies** | Often hybrid (branch + online). | **Leader:** Doshi de-risks slow onboarding → keeps user engaged while docs/KYC processed. | **Contributor:** Teaches how to use mortgage/savings product in early days. |
| **Credit Unions** | Manual, paperwork-heavy. | **Leader:** Doshi keeps intent alive during long onboarding (“while you wait, learn how your loan works”). | **Contributor:** Smooths loan onboarding → repayment plans, credit score hygiene in first week. |

## 4. Early Usage (Activation)

| Institution | Buyer Journey | Doshi (New Customers) | Doshi (Existing Customers) |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Big Banks** | Push app adoption, transactions, overdrafts. | **Leader:** Gamifies first 7 days (2 lessons + 1 savings goal). Prevents app dormancy. | **Contributor:** Nudge to activate dormant features (set DDs, make first transfer). |
| **Building Societies** | Savings + mortgage are anchors. | **Leader:** Early nudges to deposit into savings or start ISA. | **Contributor:** Education on mortgage repayments, overpayments, ISA usage. |
| **Credit Unions** | Payroll deduction savings, small loans. | **Leader:** Doshi reinforces first savings habit. | **Contributor:** Debt coaching, on-time repayment nudges in first 30 days. |

## 5. Deepening Relationship (Cross-sell / Upsell)

| Institution | Buyer Journey | Doshi (New Customers) | Doshi (Existing Customers) |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Big Banks** | Cross-sell credit cards, loans, insurance. | **Leader:** Doshi primes intent with “understanding credit/mortgage” → leads to product. | **Contributor:** Targeted journeys tied to accounts held → e.g., saver → ISA explainer, borrower → insurance. |
| **Building Societies** | Mortgage is anchor → deepen with savings, ISAs, family accounts. | **Leader:** “How mortgages work” modules → funnel to product advisors. | **Contributor:** Content-led upsell into family savings/ISA. |
| **Credit Unions** | Limited range (loans, savings, insurance). | **Leader:** Education highlights fair-loan access → increase loan uptake. | **Contributor:** Upsell insurance/debt consolidation via nudges. |

## 6. Loyalty & Advocacy

| Institution | Buyer Journey | Doshi (New Customers) | Doshi (Existing Customers) |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Big Banks** | Loyalty weak, advocacy rare. | **Leader:** Builds perception of *“bank cares”* early on. | **Contributor:** Ongoing coaching creates stickiness, less likely to churn. |
| **Building Societies** | Loyalty stronger due to mutuality. | **Leader:** Reinforces narrative from the start. | **Contributor:** Keeps emotional tie alive with continuous coaching. |
| **Credit Unions** | Highest loyalty, advocacy community-driven. | **Leader:** Positions CU as modern yet still “people-first.” | **Contributor:** Strengthens existing advocacy by making members feel supported. |

## 7. Renewal / Churn

| Institution | Buyer Journey | Doshi (New Customers) | Doshi (Existing Customers) |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Big Banks** | High churn, low loyalty. | **Leader:** Not relevant (customer hasn’t yet cycled). | **Contributor:** Retention via nudges around debt mgmt & saving. |
| **Building Societies** | Moderate churn, long tenure via mortgages. | **Leader:** Not relevant. | **Contributor:** Lessons on refinancing, switching → reduces attrition. |
| **Credit Unions** | Low churn, risk of outgrowing. | **Leader:** Not relevant. | **Contributor:** Keeps members engaged with content even if product range is narrow. |
